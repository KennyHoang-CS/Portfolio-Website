                    <h1>Hi, welcome to my site.</h1>
                    <p>Got a problem? I will turn that problem into an opportunity.<br><br>
                        I have worked in a high-paced environment of the fast-food industry, 3+ years at McDonald's to be exact. 
                        The average Joe wouldn't survive working past 3+ months at McDonald's, because fast-food industries are 
                        highly notorious for their high turnover rates. But not me, I persevered, and through that perseverance, 
                        I began my journey in coding.<br><br>
                        
                        McDonald's has embodied me the skills: communication, customer-focused, multitasking, and team mentality. 
                        Now, I take those skills along with the knowledge of my B.S. degree in Computer Science to my next journey 
                        at Springboard. I am currently working towards a certification 'Software Engineering Career Track' while learning 
                        all the latest technologies used in Full-Stack Development with real-world applications. These skills consist of 
                        Front-End, Back-End with Python, Flask, SQL, Node and Express, ReactJS, and Redux along with other tools. 
                        
                        <br><br>
